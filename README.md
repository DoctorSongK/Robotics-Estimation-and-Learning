# Robotics-Estimation-and-Learning
Coursera MOOC on  Robotics: Estimation and Learning

This repository contains the MATLAB code corresponding to different projects belonging to the online course on Robotics: Estimation and Learning.

1. Learning, Detection and Tracking
A multivariate Gaussian model is learned to detect a yellow ball and a Kalman filter is implemented to track the ball in 2D space.

2. Robotic Mapping - Occpancy Grid Mapping
The occupancy grid mapping algorithm is implemented for a 2D floor. The range sensor readings and known poses at each of the measurement times are incorporated in order to build this map.

3. Pose tracking using a Particle Filter
A particle filter is implemented for the purpose of robot localization using LIDAR measurements in 2D space for a known occupancy grid map.
